STUN: Simple Traversal of UDP protocol Through NATs</A>
</H1>

<P>
STUN is a protocol that allows users to discover if there is 
a NAT between them and the public Internet and, in this case, 
the type of the NAT. It allows to discover if there is an UDP firewall too.  
With STUN, a peer-to-peer application can determine the public network address
allocated to it by the NAT, without require any special NAT behavior. 
The STUN's objective is to provide a mechanism for NATs traversal and allows 
applications to work through the existing NAT infrastructure.
This section resumes the STUN protocol defined in RFC 3489 [<A
 HREF="node21.html#rfc_3489">12</A>]

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00611000000000000000">
Terminology</A>
</H2>

<P>
In the STUN protocol there are two principal entities: a STUN client, that generates 
the STUN requests, and the STUN server that receives the STUN requests, 
and send STUN responses.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00612000000000000000">
Overview of operations</A>
</H2>

<P>
To know behind what type of NAT the client is and to discover his public network
address, it starts the STUN discovery procedure sending the initial 
<I>Binding Request</I> to server using UDP [mattere nota per TCP]. 
A <I>Binding Request</I> that arrives to the server may have traversed one or multiple NAT 
levels, and it source address will be the mapped address created by the NAT closest
to the server. The server puts this address in a <I>Binding Response</I>
message and sends it back to the source IP address and port of the request.
The client compare the local IP and port with these send by the server. If the addresses 
are the same, between the client and the open Internet there are not NATs boxes. 
In the case of a mismatching one or more NATS are present.

<P>
If the NAT is a full-cone, the public IP and port mapped by the NAT are 
public and any host can use them to communicate with the user behind the NAT.
But the user is not sure that the NAT is a full-cone and if everybody can 
join it on this address. For this reason, it's necessary to follow 
in the STUN discovery procedure.

<P>
The client sends a second <I>Binding Request</I> from the same IP and port address 
but to a different IP address, to a second STUN server that reply with the 
public IP and port address that NAT mapped for this communication. 
If they are different from those in the first <I>Binding Response</I>, the client knows 
it is behind a symmetric NAT.
Otherwise, the client just  knows that the NAT is not a symmetric type and it must to
continues the discover procedure. 
It sends a <I>Binding Request</I> with flags that tell to the server to send a response
from a different IP address and port than the request was received on. 
If the client receives this response, it knows it is behind a full cone NAT. 
Otherwise the NAT can be a port restricted cone NAT or just a restricted cone NAT. 
To discover it, the client ask to STUN server, to sending a <I>Binding Response</I>
from the same IP address than the request was received on, but from onother port.
If a responce is received, the client is behind a just restricted NAT.
